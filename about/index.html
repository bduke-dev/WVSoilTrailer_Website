                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The West Virginia Soil Tunnel Trailer project was created to promote and assist with soil and water health education, as well as promotion of specialty crops in West Virginia. Growing specialty crops in West Virginia soils often takes a different approach with yearly soil amendments to promote successful yields. Providing this information gives more growing power to producers and begins to “plant the seed” of curiosity in children throughout the state. Our goal from inception of this project was to bridge the disconnect between the community and fresh foods.
                </p>
                <p>The motivation behind the project is the outreach and education programs for all West Virginia communities that our district and agency provides. Having a unit that gave not only a 3- dimensional tour of life inside of the soil, but the opportunity to educate through outdoor classroom stations in an exclusive setting. Getting the program and curriculum into the public was very important given the surge of interest in farming, both on a large and small scale, in schools and urban settings that West Virginia is experiencing today.</p>
                <p>Our district has, since 1938, focused solely on increasing crop as well as grazing production through soil health and education.</p>
